## Dependancies 
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

## Controls

- Pause with space
- Zoom with arrow up/down
- Speed up/down with right/left arrow
- Pan with WASD
- Q to center camera
- C to clear board
- Left click to add cells
- Right click to remove cells

## Information about the Game

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

For some examples of patterns to use (other than randomly dragging your cursor around) see [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns) 

## Things to add
- Better Navigation (zoom and pan)
- More optimized processing of states
- In game HUD for information about the board/settings
- Stamping capabilities for premade patterns
- in game changes to the BORN/SURVIVE values to change possible states
- Multi-state for more than just binary
- Saving/Loading states
- Seperating game loop and UI loop
- Adding max bounds
- Adding wrapping
- etc

## Contribution

Feel free to fork or use this repository as you wish, I have no ownership rights over the game itself. Go nuts, just send over a pull request. 

**Currently only tested on Windows 10 with Python 3.8.5 and pygame 1.9.6**
